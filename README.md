# QuanTaxoMania

### Quantum Representation of Taxonomy

**QuanTaxoMania** is an innovative project designed to represent taxonomies using quantum principles. The tool encodes hierarchical taxonomic structures such as hypernyms and hyponyms into quantum states, leveraging the unique properties of quantum computing for efficient taxonomy analysis and classification.

## Introduction

Taxonomy is a fundamental aspect of knowledge representation, typically represented through hierarchical structures. **QuanTaxoMania** aims to merge taxonomy with quantum computing by providing a framework for representing and processing taxonomies in a quantum state space.

This project is inspired by the challenges of large-scale taxonomy modeling, where the properties of quantum systems (superposition, entanglement, etc.) can offer computational advantages for tasks like classification, similarity computation, and taxonomic inference.

## Features

- Quantum encoding of taxonomic hierarchies
- Support for taxonomic operations (hypernyms, hyponyms, part-whole relationships)
- Quantum circuit generation for taxonomy traversal
- Simulation on classical hardware using quantum libraries
- Integration with quantum frameworks like Qiskit or Pennylane

## Installation

To run QuanTaxoMania locally, you will need to have Python and several dependencies installed. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuanTaxoMania.git
    cd QuanTaxoMania
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install quantum libraries such as **Qiskit** or **Pennylane**:

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit pennylane
    ```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary modules from the project:

    ```python
    from quantaxomania import QuantumTaxonomy
    ```

2. Load your taxonomy data:

    ```python
    taxonomy = QuantumTaxonomy('data/taxonomy.json')
    ```

3. Generate quantum representations:

    ```python
    quantum_state = taxonomy.encode()
    ```

4. Perform operations like taxonomy traversal, similarity measurement, or classification:

    ```python
    similarity = taxonomy.compute_similarity(term1, term2)
    ```

5. You can also simulate quantum circuits:

    ```python
    taxonomy.simulate_quantum_circuit()
    ```

For detailed instructions on the available methods and utilities, refer to the [Documentation](docs/documentation.md).

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use **QuanTaxoMania** for practical tasks:

- [Example 1: Taxonomy Encoding](examples/taxonomy_encoding.py)
- [Example 2: Quantum Classification](examples/quantum_classification.py)
- [Example 3: Similarity Calculation](examples/similarity_calculation.py)

## Quantum Theory Background

QuanTaxoMania relies on foundational concepts of quantum computing, such as:

- **Quantum Superposition**: Encoding taxonomic elements as superpositions of states.
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Capturing relationships (hypernym/hyponym) between elements.
- **Quantum Measurement**: Inferring taxonomic classifications through quantum measurements.

For users unfamiliar with quantum computing, we recommend reviewing basic quantum theory concepts before diving into the code.

Data
-----------------

The original data used could be access from SemEval-2016 Task 13: Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation.

We also provide our processed data under the `data` folder.  Credits to [repo](https://github.com/yueyu1030/STEAM)!


Requirement
----------------------
All required packages could be found in `requirement.txt` (generated by `pip freeze`).



How To Run?
----------------------


```bash
cd ./src

python main.py
```

Key Arguments Interpretation:

- `--dataset`: Dataset option: environment or science.
- `--embed_size`: Dimension of box embeddings.
- `--margin` : Margin for containing loss ($\delta$ in paper).
